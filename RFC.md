# ToDoList

# What is this project ? 

This project is an android application that will be used to store tasks that needs to be done with their description and their due dates
 
# How i did it ? 

I used Android Studio to code in Java and build the apk. I make unit test with Espresso API. I used SQLiteDatabase to store task even when the application is quit. It is a really simple application that make me want to discover a lot more about programming mobile application

# What can we do with this application 

You can add and delete tasks. In the future you could view another activity with a lot more of feature like editing tasks, making a recurrent task and a lot more.
